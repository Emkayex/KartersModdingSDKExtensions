# Karters Modding SDK Extensions
This repository will contain an collection of scripts and other tools to extend the official modding SDK for The Karters 2: Turbo Charged.

Any Unity editor extensions can copied to your modding tools directory, or you can keep this repository elsewhere and then symlink it from your modding tools directory. I recommend symlinking the tools so you can just use `git fetch` and `git pull` to update any of the tools to the latest version.

Each tool will have its own README describing how to use it. If any are missing, please an open an issue so I can add one.
